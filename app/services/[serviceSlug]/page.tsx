  crowded: {
    intro: [
      "Crowded teeth are the most common orthodontic issue in UK adults. They occur when there is not enough space in the jaw for all your teeth to fit in their natural position, causing them to overlap, twist, or push forward. Beyond the cosmetic impact, crowding makes proper brushing and flossing difficult, increasing your risk of decay, gum disease, and bad breath.",
      "Invisalign treats crowded teeth by using a sequence of clear aligners that apply controlled pressure to gradually create space and guide each tooth into alignment. For mild crowding, Invisalign Lite (up to 14 aligners) is often sufficient and can be completed in 6 to 12 months. Moderate to severe crowding typically requires Invisalign Comprehensive with unlimited aligners over 12 to 18 months.",
      "Platinum and Diamond providers are particularly important for crowding cases because they understand how to use interproximal reduction (IPR), sequential distalization, and SmartForce attachments to create space without extracting teeth. Less experienced providers may default to extractions when a skilled clinician could achieve the same result with advanced aligner techniques.",
    ],
    benefits: [
      { title: 'Easier to Clean', desc: 'Straightening crowded teeth makes brushing and flossing significantly more effective, reducing your long-term risk of cavities and periodontal disease.' },
      { title: 'No Extractions Needed', desc: 'Platinum providers use IPR and sequential distalization techniques to create space without removing healthy teeth in the majority of crowding cases.' },
      { title: 'Gradual, Comfortable Movement', desc: 'SmartTrack aligners apply gentle pressure across multiple teeth simultaneously, making the process more comfortable than braces tightening.' },
      { title: 'Predictable Digital Planning', desc: 'ClinCheck maps every millimetre of movement before treatment begins, so you know exactly how your crowding will resolve and when.' },
    ],
    candidateIntro: "You may be a good candidate for Invisalign crowded teeth treatment if you experience any of the following:",
    candidates: [
      "Teeth that overlap or sit behind each other",
      "Difficulty flossing between tightly packed teeth",
      "Teeth that have shifted after childhood braces",

  gaps: {
    intro: [
      "Gaps between teeth, known clinically as diastema, can occur anywhere in the mouth but are most commonly seen between the upper front teeth. They can be caused by a mismatch between jaw size and tooth size, missing teeth, gum disease, or habits like thumb sucking in childhood. While some people are comfortable with their gaps, others find they trap food, affect their speech, or impact their confidence.",
      "Invisalign closes gaps by applying targeted pressure to move teeth together. For small gaps affecting only the front teeth, Invisalign Express (up to 7 aligners) can achieve results in as little as 3 to 6 months. Larger or multiple gaps may require Invisalign Lite or Comprehensive depending on the overall alignment of your bite.",
      "One advantage of using a Platinum provider for gap closure is their ability to plan tooth movement that maintains proper bite alignment. Simply pushing teeth together without considering how the upper and lower arches meet can create bite problems. Experienced providers use ClinCheck to ensure gap closure improves both aesthetics and function.",
    ],
    benefits: [
      { title: 'Fast Results for Small Gaps', desc: 'Single gaps between front teeth can often be closed with Invisalign Express in 3 to 6 months, making it one of the quickest treatment types.' },
      { title: 'No Impact on Bite', desc: 'Platinum providers plan gap closure to maintain proper occlusion, ensuring your bite stays balanced as teeth move together.' },
      { title: 'Discreet Treatment', desc: 'Clear aligners are virtually invisible, so nobody needs to know you are closing gaps unless you tell them.' },

  },
  overbite: {
    intro: [
      "An overbite occurs when the upper front teeth overlap the lower front teeth by more than the normal 2 to 3 millimetres. A deep overbite can cause the lower teeth to bite into the roof of the mouth, leading to wear on the front teeth, jaw pain, and difficulty eating. It is one of the most common bite issues in UK adults and is often accompanied by crowding.",
      "Invisalign corrects overbites using a combination of aligner pressure and, in many cases, Precision Wings. These are built-in features that encourage the lower jaw to move forward while the aligners simultaneously adjust tooth positions. This dual-action approach means Invisalign can now treat overbites that were previously considered braces-only cases.",
      "Overbite correction is one of the most technically demanding Invisalign treatments, which is why provider experience matters enormously. Platinum and Diamond providers have the clinical hours and ClinCheck expertise to plan complex vertical and horizontal tooth movements that resolve the overbite without creating new problems elsewhere in the bite.",
    ],
    benefits: [
      { title: 'Reduces Tooth Wear', desc: 'Correcting the overbite prevents the lower teeth from grinding against the upper teeth or the palate, preserving enamel long-term.' },
      { title: 'Precision Wing Technology', desc: 'Advanced Invisalign features move the jaw and teeth simultaneously, something previously only possible with braces and headgear.' },
      { title: 'Improved Jaw Comfort', desc: 'Many patients with deep overbites experience jaw tension or TMJ discomfort that improves significantly as the bite is corrected.' },
      { title: 'No Headgear Required', desc: 'Precision Wings are built into the aligners themselves, eliminating the need for external headgear or elastics in most cases.' },
    ],

    ],
  },
  underbite: {
    intro: [
      "An underbite occurs when the lower teeth sit in front of the upper teeth when the jaw is closed. This can be caused by lower jaw overgrowth, upper jaw underdevelopment, or a combination of both. Underbites affect chewing efficiency, speech clarity, and facial profile, and tend to worsen with age if left untreated.",
      "Invisalign can correct mild to moderate dental underbites by moving the lower teeth backward and the upper teeth forward using a combination of aligners and elastic attachments. For skeletal underbites caused by jaw size discrepancy, Invisalign may be used in combination with other treatments, and your provider will advise on the best approach during your consultation.",
      "Underbite cases require careful planning to avoid destabilising the bite during treatment. Platinum providers understand how to sequence tooth movements to maintain functional contact throughout the process, which is critical for cases involving both upper and lower arch adjustments.",
    ],
    benefits: [
      { title: 'Improved Chewing', desc: 'Correcting the underbite restores proper contact between upper and lower teeth, making biting and chewing significantly more efficient.' },

    ],
  },
  crossbite: {
    intro: [
      "A crossbite occurs when one or more upper teeth bite inside the lower teeth rather than outside. This can affect the front teeth (anterior crossbite) or the back teeth (posterior crossbite). Crossbites cause uneven tooth wear, jaw shifting, gum recession on the affected teeth, and can lead to TMJ problems if left untreated.",
      "Invisalign corrects crossbites by expanding or shifting the affected teeth into their correct position relative to the opposing arch. Posterior crossbites may require palatal expansion in younger patients, but in adults, Invisalign can often achieve sufficient tooth movement to resolve the crossbite without additional appliances.",
      "Crossbite correction requires precise control of individual tooth movements in three dimensions. This is where provider experience is critical. Platinum providers use optimised SmartForce attachments and staging protocols to achieve crossbite correction predictably, while less experienced providers may struggle with the rotational and lateral movements required.",
    ],
    benefits: [
      { title: 'Prevents Gum Recession', desc: 'Crossbite teeth under abnormal pressure are at higher risk of gum recession. Correcting the crossbite removes this risk.' },
      { title: 'Eliminates Jaw Shifting', desc: 'Many crossbite patients unconsciously shift their jaw to compensate, causing muscle tension and TMJ symptoms that resolve with treatment.' },
      { title: 'Even Tooth Wear', desc: 'Correcting the crossbite distributes biting forces evenly, preventing premature wear on individual teeth.' },
      { title: '3D Precision Control', desc: 'SmartForce attachments give Invisalign precise control over the complex rotational movements crossbite correction demands.' },

  adults: {
    intro: [
      "Invisalign for adults is the most popular clear aligner treatment in the UK, suitable for patients of any age who want to straighten their teeth without visible braces. Whether you missed out on orthodontic treatment as a teenager, your teeth have shifted over the years, or you had braces as a child and your teeth have relapsed, Invisalign offers a discreet and effective solution.",
      "Adults make up the fastest-growing segment of orthodontic patients in the UK. According to the British Orthodontic Society, one in five orthodontic patients is now an adult. The primary drivers are the availability of invisible treatment options, shorter treatment times, and the ability to preview results digitally before committing.",
      "Our network specialises in connecting adults with Platinum and Diamond providers because adult treatment has specific clinical considerations. Adult bone is denser than adolescent bone, which affects how teeth move. Root resorption risk needs to be monitored. Existing dental work like crowns, bridges, or implants may need to be accounted for in the treatment plan. High-tier providers manage these factors routinely.",
